    /*
     * In mathematics, a **perfect number** is a positive integer that is **equal to
     * the sum of its positive divisors (excluding itself)**. Here's a breakdown:
     ** 
     * Definition:**
     * 
     * Let **n** be a positive integer.
     * **n** is a perfect number if:
     * 
     * ```
     * n = d1 + d2 + ... + dn
     * ```
     * 
     * where:
     * 
     * **d1, d2, ..., dn** are the **positive divisors of n** (excluding 1 and n
     * itself).
     ** 
     * Examples:**
     * 
     * **6**: Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect
     * number.
     * **28**: Its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, so
     * 28 is a perfect number.
     * **10**: Its divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. 1 + 2 + 5 â‰  10, so 10 is not a
     * perfect number.
     ** 
     * Additional notes:**
     * 
     * Perfect numbers have been studied since ancient times, and their properties
     * continue to fascinate mathematicians.
     * Only a few small perfect numbers are known: 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33550336.
     * It is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers, or whether
     * any odd perfect numbers exist.
     * 
     * I hope this explanation clarifies what perfect numbers are!
